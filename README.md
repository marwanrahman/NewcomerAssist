The Newcomer Assistance Center site is aimed to assist newcomers in Mississauga with the process of adapting to life in Canada. I aim to create a collection of services and information that is simple and easily accessable for all. We also assembled this site to be bilingual, in an attempt to welcome the new arabic speaking population in Mississauga.
